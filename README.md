StoQueX stands for Stock Quotes Explorer. As it is implied, it's an app used to explore quotes from a database maximum storage capacity on Heroku.

StoQueX is a school project used to learn the basic principles behind the development of a web app. This version of StoQueX was built by [Maxime Aubaret](github.com/maximeaubaret) and [Alexandre Toni](github.com/kickout).

Live Demo
---------
To see StoQueX running live, you can go on http://pg217.herokuapp.com/. In this version, only AAPL, MSFT and GOOG are  

Database structure
------------------
The database is composed of 2 tables: *symbols* and *quotes*.

- *symbols* symbolizes a company's name, business or place where the stock is traded.
- *quotes* provides a list of quoted values at a certain date.
